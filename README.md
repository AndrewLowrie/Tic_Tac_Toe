In following a course in Python the first project to build is a simple
game of tic tac toe for two players.

I found building the individual functions comfortable enough, but the game logic was not easy and I had to refer to some course materials to finish it.

A particular error I had was making a board for indexes 0-8, telling the user on their side it was 1-9 and just accounting for it in the code. This gave me a whole host of issues when playing the game itself.

Eventually I just changed the indexes to 1-9 as the course content suggested and this required reworking multiple functions. Sometimes the 'clever' solutions aren't actually all that clever. It's a good learning experience and I think it will help me with a couple other solo challenges I am working on.
